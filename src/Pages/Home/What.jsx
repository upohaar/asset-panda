          The better question is, what isn’t an asset? From IT and construction
          to education and retail, every business has items of value that they
          need to keep track of. Some are digital, like contracts and software
          licenses, while others are physical, like laptops and vehicle fleets.
          Whatever you’re tracking, we’re here to help your team improve
          efficiency and save time and money.

                Better asset tracking leads to better business performance –
                when you keep your equipment in working order and know where it
